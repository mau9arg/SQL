# In this project I took this list of the top 50 songs of 2021 in Spotify and came up with some queries and questions

# Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

# I decided to try and answer some basic questions about the data first. 
# I checked the average danceability, energy, and popularity by artist and track name
SELECT artist_name, avg(danceability), avg(popularity), track_name, avg(energy) FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name

# I then decided to see which songs went over 3 minutes long, or in this case 180,000 ms
SELECT artist_name, track_name, duration_ms FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name
HAVING HAVING (duration_ms/60000) >= 3

# I also wanted to see the Top 10 most popular songs
select artist_name, track_name, popularity from BIT_DB.Spotifydata
order by popularity desc 
limit 10
